#Al-Mustafa Jewelry #
Al-Mustafa Jewelry Store has a wide range of jewelry collection which either they order from their suppliers. The shop mostly sells only 22 karat gold and do not buys or sell less than 22 karat gold. It’s main purpose is to provide with authentic and good quality product with great customer services to its customer. The shop was formed in 2001 and since then it has been providing high quality jewelry its customer and its vision is to grow even more.
The success of this shop is defined by how great they have been providing customer services. The shop does not have a wide area so there are limited number of employees in the shop which are mostly person from their own family and two external employees. 
The shop maintains all its sale records and supplier’s data in a register and has a file based approach in their billing system. According to the owner of the company it is easy to maintain all of its purchasing and selling but it becomes tedious when they have to search  a record because there is a pile of register to be searched so it consumes a lot of time for them when they have to go through a stack of records to find a particular one
